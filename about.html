<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Our group is a part of Girls Who Code Emory. We are Addison Allvine, Sasha Byron, and Emma Lilly. We got help from Rebecca Luo, Daisy Kim, and . At Girls Who Code, girls from 3rd to 5th and 6th to 12th grade are taught female empowerment through coding and computer programming. Girls are encouraged to work hard and are put in a healthy and safe environment where they can code and be themselves.</p>

<h2>Why did we choose this topic?</h2>
<p>Quarentining for Corona virus has really harmed the mental health of millions of people all around the Earth. We created this website for the people who believe they, or someone else they know, are hurting. We are spreading awareness and hope this website can allow us to help you as much as possible, whether that be research or if you need someone to talk to.</p>
