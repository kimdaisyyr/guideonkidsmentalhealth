<h2>Mental Health is complicated to check up on. Here is information on how to help others.</h2>
    <p>Before ensuring you're mentally healthy. You need to know what mental health is. Mental health is the way you think, act, and feel. It affects the 'thinking' part of your brain. And controls what you do and say. Just because you have a mental illness, doesn't mean you're crazy or need to go to a hospital. Sometimes, things such as savant syndrome can be beneficial to your mental health. You need to take care of your mental health, as it is very important for your physical health too. Normally mental issues root from when you are born, but sometimes the environment or people around you can affect how you think too. Now then! Let's get mental! :)</p>
<br>
    <p>One of the most common yet deadly mental illness is Depression. Depression is a mental illness that makes you feel sad, angry, or any negative emotion. Experience negative emotions is completely normal. But with depression it is constant, and ongoing. Depression is dangerous because it can lead to suicide, which is the leading cause of death within teenagers. Suicide is the act of ending your own life. Signs of depression are sadness, lack of motivation, difficulty to stop crying, aggrivation, isolation, and more.</p>

    <p>ADHD, and/or ADD also known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADD without the hyperactivity. It is not as deadly but can be difficult for those with it to properly do work or school. It is quite self explanatory, anyone with this disorder has an extremely hard time focusing or paying attention. It's quite common, signs of ADD or ADHD are; difficulty consentrating, difficulty sitting still, difficulty to stop talking and more.</p>
<p>Another form of mental illness is called Autism. Autism starts from when you are born. Autism affects your interaction and socializing skills. Signs of autism are; aggressiveness, disruptiveness, loud or sudden noises, delayed speech or not responding at all, difficulty with eye contact.</p>
 <p>Just because you have mental illness doesn't make you insane. Mental health and mental illnesses are just obstacles of life that everyone eventually has to overcome. If we learn that mental illnesses are not always negative, then less people can be scared of things linked to them.</p>
